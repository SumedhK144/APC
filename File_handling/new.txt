The  open() system call opens the file specified by pathname.  If the specified file does not ex‐
       ist, it may optionally (if O_CREAT is specified in flags) be created by open().

       The return value of open() is a file descriptor, a small, nonnegative integer that is an index to
       an entry in the process's table of open file descriptors.  The file descriptor is used in  subse‐
       quent system calls (read(2), write(2), lseek(2), fcntl(2), etc.)  to refer to the open file.  The
       file  descriptor  returned  by  a successful call will be the lowest-numbered file descriptor not
       currently open for the process.

       By default, the new file descriptor is  set  to  remain  open  across  an  execve(2)  (i.e.,  the
       FD_CLOEXEC file descriptor flag described in fcntl(2) is initially disabled); the O_CLOEXEC flag,
       described  below, can be used to change this default.  The file offset is set to the beginning of
       the file (see lseek(2)).
